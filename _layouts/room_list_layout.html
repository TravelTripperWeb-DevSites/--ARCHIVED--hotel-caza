  Name:

    Room List Page

  Description:

    Displays a list of room models enhanced with dynamic data from reztrip.
    Allows user editable regions via the generic layout.

  Usage:

    To customize the rendering of each room model, create your own _includes/components/room file.
    In general, use the editable regions available from the "generic" layout to add content above and below the rooms list.
    To add custom components/content to the page, write that content in the body of the page that uses this layout and it will be included after the room list.
