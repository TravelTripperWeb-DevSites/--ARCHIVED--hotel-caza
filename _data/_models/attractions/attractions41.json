Others were being seated around us and were being waited on almost immediately or within the first two minutes. Where was our waiter/waitress? Not a single person came to our table from the time we sat down to the time we got up and walked out. No hostess at the front to complain to either. Wait staff were literally standing around chatting with one another. I made eye contact with a few but they pretended not to notice &/or kept walking. Incredibly upsetting. I understand it's a busy place but a simple acknowledgement and promise to be with us shortly would have made me feel so much better; I wouldn't have minded waiting if someone would have just made us feel validated. What a shame. So very disappointed. On the bright side, there is a plethora of other wonderful establishments in the vicinity with much better service to dine at.\n\nEdit: I would like to say that the hostess was kind, though and seated us immediately.",

Thick milky soup was fabulous; warm soup was perfect with the chilly weather; however could have been a bit more generous on the clams. The special for the day - grilled salmon and shrimp was pretty good. Portion is reasonably big.",
