          "text": "Good place to visit and hangout with family and friends. The “Golden Gate” refers to the strait through which boats go to enter the Bay. It was originally named by U.S. army officer John Fremont in 1846. \nThe hills surroundings the bridge are themselves golden in color much of the year and when the sun is at the right angle it has an extremely beautiful golden glow. The bridge is simply the bridge that spans the Golden Gate Strait.\n The Golden Gate bridge is regularly painted. Every state in the United States has a bridge maintenance and inspection plan. \nWhen built, it was the bridge with the longest span bridge in the world till 1964. Now it is the ninth-longest suspension bridge in the world.  It is famous for its extraordinary design. \nOne  can swim, across the strait but completely at one's own risk. One can come in at Fort Baker on the North side or at Ft Point on the South. Both are rocky entries and you should visit and enter them during daylight.",
