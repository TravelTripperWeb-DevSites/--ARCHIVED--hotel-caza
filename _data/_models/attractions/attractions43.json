As I have observed, most visitors end up wasting a large portion of their ice creams. \nThe only plus side - thankfully, parking has never been an issue!\nIf you want to save yourself some grief, do visit the Stockton location.

          "text": "Ghirardelli Square is filled with boutiques, restaurants, a beer garden and the Ghirardelli Chocolate Shop. On arrival into the shop you are offered a complimentray chocolate square. Yum! There are a variety of goods and souvenirs around the shop, as well as baking needs. My favorite part of this shop is the amazing variety of ice cream dishes that are offered. The place packs up fast, so seating is very difficult to find. Some tables have views of the gorgeous San Francisco Bay and Alcatraz. I ordered the Famous Hot Fudge Sundae and a chocolate chip cookie ( requesting it warmed up), it was heaven. There is a smaller ice cream shop on the street level that is also Ghirardelli. Parking is convenient in the garage as well.",

          "text": "The chocolate is amazing, of course, but pretty expensive. The lawn/park out front is wonderful, and the small beach is very cool, too. Fun to watch swimmers doing laps in the ocean water. And it's a fun walk down fisherman's wharf, too. And then there's the pier where you can take a tour of old boats. A very nice place to spend an afternoon.",
